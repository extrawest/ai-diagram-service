This Java Spring Boot service leverages TogetherAI's advanced models to convert image and text inputs into PlantUML diagrams. It provides an API that accepts images and text descriptions as input, processes them through TogetherAIâ€™s machine learning models, and outputs structured PlantUML code. The service facilitates quick and accurate diagram generation, particularly useful for transforming visual or textual information into clear and professional UML diagrams. This service is an ideal solution for teams needing automated, high-quality UML diagram generation from varied data inputs.
